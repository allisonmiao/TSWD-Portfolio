# Part I: Final project

Final Project Overview

## An outline

### High-Level Summary

This project aims to visualize the progression of gender and racial/ethnic equality within the entertainment industry in the United States over time. By leveraging historical data on casting, award nominations, and wins across major film, television, and music sectors, the study seeks to uncover trends and shifts in the representation of women and minority racial/ethnic groups. The project will explore several decades of data to depict how inclusivity and diversity within these spheres have evolved, potentially correlating these trends with major cultural and policy changes influencing the industry. Through comprehensive data visualization, this project intends to provide insights into the effectiveness of diversity initiatives and the changing landscape of entertainment in terms of equality.

## The data
For this project, a primary source of data will be the "Distribution of employees in the motion picture and video industries in the United States in 2023, by ethnicity" provided by Statista ([link](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1276600/motion-pictures-video-industries-employees-share-by-ethnicity-united-states/#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20almost%2077%20percent,U.S.%20film%20industry%20were%20male.)). This dataset offers a comprehensive breakdown of the ethnic composition of employees within the U.S. motion picture and video industries as of 2023. The data is categorized by various ethnic groups, providing insights into the diversity of the workforce in these sectors.

Additionally, I will explore other relevant datasets that track the distribution of roles, awards, and nominations across genders and ethnic groups in historical contexts. These may include databases like IMDb for comprehensive filmography data and specific awards databases for tracking major entertainment awards across different demographics over time.

## Method and medium

For my final project, I will use Tableau to effectively visualize the progression of gender and racial/ethnic equality in the U.S. entertainment industry. I'll import and clean the necessary datasets. In Tableau, I will create a series of interactive charts and dashboards that allow for a dynamic exploration of trends over time. This will include line graphs to show changes, bar charts to display demographic distributions, and filters to examine specific aspects like role types or award categories.
