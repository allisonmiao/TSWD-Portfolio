# About Me
My name is Allison Miao (she/her), and I recently earned my Master's degree in Information Systems Management, with a concentration in Business Intelligence & Data Analytics, from Carnegie Mellon University. This program equipped me with the technical and strategic skills to manage and analyze data effectively, preparing me to tackle complex challenges at the intersection of technology and business.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Business Economics from The Ohio State Universityâ€™s Fisher College of Business, where I developed a strong foundation in economic analysis and its practical applications in business decision-making.

I am currently seeking full-time opportunities where I can contribute to data-driven initiatives, collaborate across teams, and continue learning in dynamic and impact-oriented environments. I look forward to connecting with professionals and exploring roles where I can apply my skills to drive meaningful outcomes.

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn: [LinkedIn Page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allison-yuhan-miao/)

## What I hope to learn
My goal is to master the techniques of translating complex data sets into clear and compelling visual stories that can influence decision-making and strategic thinking. 

Upon graduating, I plan to pursue a career where I can provide these capabilities, ideally as a product manager, consultant, or data analyst. Each of these roles requires a unique blend of analytical skills and creative thinking.
